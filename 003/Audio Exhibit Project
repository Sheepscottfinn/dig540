Audio Exhibition Project
How's It Goin' Boy?
Diane Hoppe
In 2005, RTE Radio (Irish National radio/television) broadcast a 6 part oral history program documenting
the perspective of many residents of Cork City titled "How's it Goin' Boy?". The program was sponsored and produced
by University College Cork and the Northside Folklore Project. Participants included: coordinators, interviewers/photographers, and interviewees.
The topics covered in the audio program were: emmegration, city history, domestic life, childhood, immigration, and neighborhoods.
The project was made into an audio CD, then into a physical exhibit and book in 2007 which also included photographs and text.
The audio recorded interviews documented the context of what it is/was like to live in, come to, or leave Cork City.
How's it Goin' Boy? is a contextual oral history of life in Cork City, Ireland.
The context of the audio project was enhanced with photographs in a publication of the same title in 2007.
