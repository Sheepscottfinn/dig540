Northside Folklore Project
How’s It Goin’ Boy?
Diane Hoppe

In 2005, RTE Radio (Irish National radio/television) broadcast a 6 part oral history program documenting
the perspective of many residents of Cork City titled "How's it Goin' Boy?". The program was sponsored and produced
by University College Cork, the Northside Folklore Project, RTE, with a grant from Cork - European Capitol of Culture 2005. 
Participants included: Producers, interviewers/photographers, and contributors.
The contributors and their stories are the focus of the project. Each interview is stored on an individual tape which has been numbered, documented and transcribed. 

The interviews documented what it is/was like to live in Cork.The stories are as diverse as the contributors. 
The stories fell into the following topics: Neighborhoods, Cork history, Family, Food, Immigration, Cork City,and Sports.
How's it Goin' Boy? is an oral history project documenting the relationship of residents of Cork City, Ireland in 2005. 
The project was made into an audio CD, then into a physical exhibit and book in 2007 which included photographs and text.

The contextual understanding of the project was enhanced when the original audio project expanded to include photographs in 
	an exhibition and publication of the same name in 2007.
