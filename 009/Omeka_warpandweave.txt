The Omeka Exhibit of Warp&Weave would be an interactive exhibit that will inspire and assist weavers in planning and sharing weave projects. Weavers will be able to review contributions from other weavers for inspiration or begin the planning process for own weaving projects. Weavers can also use the site to assist in calculating the necessary materials needed for their chosen pattern. 

The most useful of Omeka’s plug-ins for this project will be the Contribution plug-in, User Profiles, and Flickr Import. These plug-ins will allow weavers to document and upload photos of their weaving progress from Flilckr. As the administrator, I would use the Exhibit Builder to pull the works together for easy public viewing. The PDF Embed plug-in will make available downloadable and printable worksheets and weaving tips and hints. What is missing is a Warp and Weave Calculation Worksheet. I would design this calculation worksheet to make the project planning process easier for the weaver. This plug-in would consist of forms that allows the weaver to submit project data such as the length and width of the project as well as the weight of the yarn or ends planned per inch. The Weave Calculator will generate the approximate yardage needed to complete the weavers chosen project.
